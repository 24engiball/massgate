

Thank you for your interest in World in Conflict. 

Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft has released the game for free, including the server environment. You are playing on one such environment - not supported by the original developers.

But we hope you have great fun! We had great fun making the game, and we hope to join you as players here in the future.
